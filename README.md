## Dataset description
As a part of the '[Influencer Marketing Research](https://sites.google.com/site/sbkimcv/research?authuser=0#h.p_ID_38)', I collected data from Instagram and share it for the research purpose. 
The dataset contains 33,935 influencers with their 10,180,500 Instagram posts. (300 posts per influencer)
Influencers are classified into the following nine categories:
1. Beauty
2. Family
3. Fashion
4. Fitness
5. Food
6. Interior
7. Pet
8. Travel
9. Other

The detailed of data collection method and the categories of influencers and posts are described in the paper "[Multimodal Post Attentive Profiling for Influencer Marketing](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3366423.3380052)" published in The Web Conference '20.
